                <p>Before registering your CBO, you need to prepare the following documents:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Draft Constitution</li>
                    <li>Complete CBO Form K (Application for Registration)</li>
                    <li>Prepare Annual Work Plan and Budget</li>

                </ol>
                
                <h4>Step 2: Submit to DNMC</h4>
                <p>Submit your application to the District Non-Governmental Monitoring Committee (DNMC):</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pay prescribed fees</li>
                    <li>Submit all required documents to the District Community Development Officer</li>
                    <li>Attend an interview with the DNMC if required</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h4>Step 3: Obtain Registration Certificate</h4>
                <p>After approval, collect your CBO Registration Certificate from the District Community Development Office.</p>
                
                <h4>Required Documents</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>CBO Constitution</li>
                    <li>List of Founding Members with their signatures</li>
                    <li>Minutes of the meeting that elected the Executive Committee</li>
                    <li>Workplan and Budget</li>
                    <li>Organizational Structure</li>
                    <li>Proof of Payment of Registration Fees</li>
                    <li>Recommendation letters from Local Council (LC1 and LC3)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Fees</h4>
                <p>Registration fees for CBOs vary by district but typically range from UGX 50,000 to UGX 100,000.</p>
                
                <h4>Important Considerations</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>CBOs are registered at the district level and operate within that district only</li>
                    <li>If you wish to operate in multiple districts, consider registering as an NGO instead</li>
                    <li>CBOs must submit annual reports to the District Community Development Office</li>
                    <li>Registration must be renewed periodically (typically every 1-2 years)</li>
                </ul>
